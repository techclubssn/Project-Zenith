<!-- MACHINE LEARNING -->
## Machine Learning

In the currently evolving field of Machine Learning, students will get to know about the fundamentals behind various algorithms and models in Machine learning and Deep Learning. 
To bolster their theoretical knowledge, practical hands-on sessions with frameworks like scikit-learn and TensorFlow will be offered and tips to improve performance will be explained. 
After gaining sufficient knowledge, students will be separated into teams and will be encouraged to work on a real world problem and develop a solution for it. 
Interested students will be encouraged to present their research findings in professional platforms such as conferences, workshops, etc., and will be guided in the same.

<!-- ANALOG INTEGRATED CIRCUIT DESIGN -->
## Analog Integrated Circuit Design


Under Analog IC Design, students are expected to design an Operational Amplifier at the end of the program. 
This involves a regular assignment and a weekly schedule which is planned to cover relevant topics and the basics that would aid the students to design Op-Amp from scratch. 
Students also gain hands-on experience working with LtSpice. This domain also provides excellent opportunities for the students to pursue their Masters as the research works are abundant. 


<!-- APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT -->
## Application Development

In this course, students will learn to develop cross platform mobile apps. Learn Flutter Framework and Dart from ground level step-by-step. 
Along the course, they will be developing a few apps that cover the various fundamentals of Flutter widgets and layout.   
Students will be given a chance to regularly share their ideas and form groups to develop it into an application. 
They also learn to integrate firebase as a backend for mobile apps. Finally, they will be taught how to publish mobile apps in Google Play Store.  


<!-- ROBOTICS -->
## Robotics

This course shall help students to taste various aspects of robotics including simulations, coding and much more. 
The students shall be primarily working on simulating a robot which would be able to move around in an environment filled with obstacles. 
Unlike conventional simple hard-coding, they will learn to control the robot using advanced control strategies. 
Assignments shall be given, which consist of robot programming to achieve specific goals each week. 
In the end, a complete system of a Obstacle Avoidance robot can be built by the student themselves.
